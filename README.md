# ember-codemod-pod-to-octane

_Codemod to un-pod Ember apps, addons, and engines_


## Usage

Step 1. Quickly return to [default Octane](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/project-layouts/#classiclayout).

```sh
cd <your/project/path>
npx ember-codemod-pod-to-octane <arguments>
```

Step 2. Remove `podModulePrefix` from `config/environment.js` and `usePods` from `.ember-cli`.

Step 3. Update relative paths in `import` statements.


### Arguments

You must pass `--type` to indicate what type of project you have.

```sh
npx ember-codemod-pod-to-octane --type=app
npx ember-codemod-pod-to-octane --type=addon
npx ember-codemod-pod-to-octane --type=engine
```


<details>
<summary>Optional: Do a test run</summary>

Pass `--test` to preview how the codemod will move files around.

```sh
npx ember-codemod-pod-to-octane --test
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Optional: Specify the project root</summary>

Pass `--root` to run the codemod against (1) a project somewhere else or (2) multiple projects (assuming you have an automation script).

```sh
npx ember-codemod-pod-to-octane --root=<your/project/path>
```

</details>


### Limitations

The codemod is designed to cover typical uses of an Ember app, addon, and engine. It is not designed to cover one-off cases.


<details>
<summary>Apps</summary>

To account for a bug (found when Ember CLI is combined with Ember Data), the codemod doesn't consider unit tests for adapters, models, and serializers. You will need to manually move the test files.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Addons</summary>

The codemod assumes that an addon is used to define components (not models or routes).

</details>


<details>
<summary>Engines</summary>

The codemod assumes that an engine is used to define routes and route-specific components.

</details>


To better meet your needs, consider forking the repo and running the codemod locally.

```sh
cd <your/forked/repo>
./bin/ember-codemod-pod-to-octane.js <arguments>
```
